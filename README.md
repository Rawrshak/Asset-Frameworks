# Asset Framework
This repo contains the drafts and final specifications for the Rawrshak Asset Framework on the Rawrshak Protocol.
They can be updated, amended, and created through Rawrshak Improvement Proposals (RIPs).

The goal for this framework is to build a guideline to how common in-game asset NFTs and its metadata should be created for common use by the gaming ecosystem. We propose this framework as a precursor to attaining a consensus for Asset Standards.

## Drafts
Specification Drafts will be in the Drafts folder. These are not final and can be updated over time.
A draft will need to go through a RIP governance vote in order to become final.

## Final
Final Specifications here are final. Any improvements will need to be a drafted and go through an RIP
before updating the final spec. These need to be backward compatible so take care not to break existing
assets in the process.
