# Asset Standards
This repo contains the drafts and final specifications for Asset Standards on the Rawrshak Protocol.
They can be updated, amended, and created through Rawrshak Improvement Proposals (RIPs).

## Drafts
Specification Drafts will be in the Drafts folder. These are not final and can be updated over time.
A standard draft will need to go through a RIP governance vote in order to become final.

## Final
Final Specifications here are final. Any improvements will need to be a drafted and go through an RIP
before updating the final spec. These need to be backward compatible so take care not to break existing
assets in the process.
